It will\nconcentrate on the relevant socio-economic data-sets, enabling the\nparticipants to complement their prior knowledge and interests with\ndata-oriented know-how. The students will learn basic statistical\ntechniques in R through hands-on sessions, getting familiar\nwith R language through joint exercises. As a result, they\nwill be able to apply various quantitative skills in their respective\nresearch projects and will be equipped with techniques to master more\nadvanced R operations in future.\nTeaching methods\nhands-on sessions;\ndemonstrations of R capabilities via the customized\nwebsite created for this course;\nexercises and assignments based on a real data\nQualification objective\nEquipping students with basic tools for data analysis in\nR that they will be able to apply in their research\nprojects and beyond.\nRequirements\nCourse attendance of more than 70%\nBased on the covered material, completion of several assignments\nin R language such as:\nExploratory data analysis\nData modelling\nData visualization\n\nDue to a variety of available R tools suited for these\npurposes, students will be encouraged to demonstrate their analytical\nand creative skills.
