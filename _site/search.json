It will concentrate on the relevant socio-economic data-sets, enabling the participants to complement their prior knowledge and interests with data-oriented know-how. The students will learn basic statistical techniques in R through hands-on sessions, getting familiar with R language through joint exercises. As a result, they will be able to apply various quantitative skills in their respective research projects and will be equipped with techniques to master more advanced R operations in future.\nTeaching methods\nhands-on sessions;\ndemonstrations of R capabilities via the customized website created for this course;\nexercises and assignments based on a real data\nQualification objective\nEquipping students with basic tools for data analysis in R that they will be able to apply in their research projects and beyond.\nRequirements\nCourse attendance of more than 70%\nBased on the covered material, completion of several assignments in R language such as:\nExploratory data analysis\nData modelling\nData visualization\n\nDue to a variety of available R tools suited for these purposes, students will be encouraged to demonstrate their analytical and creative skills. Participants will also be able to use datasets of their own choice and interest, directly applying quantitative techniques in R for their research projects.\nSelected literature to be used for the class\nWickham, H. & Grolemund, G.
